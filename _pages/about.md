I am a Lecturer in the School of Electrical and Information Engineering at Tianjin University. I completed my Ph.D. in Circuits and Systems at Tianjin University, where I was advised by Prof. Yu Liu. My research interests lie at the intersection of Electronic Design Automation (EDA), Computer Architecture, and Hardware-Software Co-design. Specifically, my work focuses on developing autonomous and controllable hardware-software systems to address "choke point" technical challenges in intelligent edge computing. This includes systematic research into RISC-V open-source architectures, reconfigurable spatial accelerators (CGRAs), hardware-aware compilation optimization, and intelligent scheduling algorithms. My goal is to bridge the gap between high-level algorithmic requirements and low-level hardware constraints through agile design and cross-layer optimization. My research has been recognized with publications in IEEE TCAD, JSA, IEEE CAL, IEEE ESL, ISCAS, and ISEDA.
