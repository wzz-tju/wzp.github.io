## About Me

I am currently a **Lecturer** at the **School of Microelectronics, Tianjin University**. I received my **Ph.D.** degree in **Circuits and Systems** from **Tianjin University**, advised by Prof. [Yu Liu](https://faculty.tju.edu.cn/liuyu/zh_CN/index.htm).

My research lies at the intersection of **Electronic Design Automation (EDA)**, **Computer Architecture**, and **Hardware–Software Co-design**. I aim to bridge the gap between high-level algorithmic requirements and low-level hardware constraints through agile design methodologies and cross-layer optimization. Specifically, my work focuses on developing **autonomous and controllable systems** to tackle critical “bottleneck” challenges in **intelligent edge computing**.

My research has been featured in premier journals and conferences, including **IEEE TCAD**, **JSA**, **IEEE CAL**, **IEEE ESL**, **ISCAS**, and **ISEDA**.
